# Analysis-and-Design-of-Advanced-Digital-Integrated-Circuits

This repository includes the solutions to the questions in "Analysis and Design of Advanced Digital Integrated Circuits" in UCAS 2021. 

There are three folders responding to three tasks. 
1. Two Stage Pipeline of Multiplication, where data is in IEEE754 standard.

2. Simple implementation of AHB to APB (comparing with ARM AHB to APB IP, my work realize the simple functions including single write, single read, burst write and burst read)

3. FFT based on 64 points with 8bit input and 20bit output. I compared the Verilog results with MATLAB results.

Details of above three tasks could be found in report.pdf. 

The Programming solutions include Verilog HDL code (and MATLAB code) and experimental report written in Chinese language in .pdf file format.

This repository is hopefully used to be a reference! Thank you :)
